# **Balanced BInary Tree**

- A height-balanced binary tree ensures that the tree's structure is optimized for operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup. This repository contains a Java program that determines if a given binary tree is height-balanced, using a recursive approach to determine the height of each subtree and check the balance condition at every node. 
- A height-balanced binary tree is defined as one in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## **Problem Statement**

Given a binary tree, determine whether it is height-balanced.

**Example**
Input: [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]

Output: true

## **Solution Approach**
* Height of a Tree: The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
* Balanced Condition: For each node, the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees should not exceed 1.

# **Getting Started**

## **Prerequisites**
* BlueJ: It is an integrated development environment for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of Java Development Kit. You can download BlueJ from the official website: https://bluej.org/.

## **Installation**
* Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
* Extract the files to your desired directory.

## **Usage**
* Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
* Download the BalancedBTree.java file and save it to your desired directory.
* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the BalancedBTree.java file is located.
* Compile the Java file using command :javac BalancedBTree.java
